									<h2>Hi there,</h2>
									<p>

										Hi, I’m Andreem (or JR), a data-driven professional passionate about technology and innovation. Currently, I work as a Genius at Apple Inc., where I play a key role in hardware/software debugging, repair, and enhancing customer experiences. My work focuses on translating complex technical concepts into actionable insights that drive both team efficiency and customer satisfaction.
										
										Throughout my career, I’ve consistently sought to bridge the gap between technology and people. Whether developing strategies that boost sales, analyze data to improve processes, or mentoring team members, my goal is to create seamless, impactful solutions that make a difference. My analytical mindset and attention to detail enable me to tackle challenges head-on, resulting in meaningful improvements and success stories.
										
										My academic journey at Rutgers University consist of a B.S. in Economics with a focus on Business Administration and Marketing. This academic background, coupled with my practical experience, equips me with a strong foundation in both the technical and business aspects of problem-solving.        

										When I’m not immersed in work or studies, I love to explore the outdoors, travel to new destinations, and express my creativity through fashion. Hiking offers me a chance to recharge and draw inspiration from nature, while traveling broadens my perspective and fuels my curiosity. Fashion, on the other hand, is my way of blending creativity with self-expression, much like the solutions I strive to create in my professional life.
										
										                                                   <a href="#">         </a> </p>  <b></b> <strong></strong><i></i>  <em></em>
